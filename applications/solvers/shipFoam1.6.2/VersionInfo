-bug fix for writing restart information (CoGtrack files).
-before, these files were writen as dictionary in the time directories. This failed however in parallel runs.
-now they are writen in main directory/CoGtrack. A simple textfile is writen with the motionPatch and time appended in the file name. The contents is a list with 8 vectors in the following order:
1. totalDisplacement
2. totalRotation
3. U_cog_old
4. Omega_cog_old (in degrees/s)
5. Fstore[0] (un-averaged force values of current timestep)
6. Fstore[1] (un-averaged force values of previous timestep)
7. Mstore[0] (as Fstore[0] but for moment)
8. Mstore[1] (idem)

Furtermore some bugs dealing with restarting and setting the correct CoG velocity values have been corrected.

-upgraded to OpenFOAM-1.6

22 december 2009
-replaced p and pd fields by one single p field to be in line with interFoam 1.6.
-joined calculation for spring coefficients in one header file and replaced this class by simple #include
-added interval counter for spring coefficients calculation so these are not calculated every time step anymore. User input (shipDict)
